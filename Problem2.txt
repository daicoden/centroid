  Now modify your solution to Problem 1 so that when multiple clients
  are connected at once, the centroid returned is the average of the
  most recent centroids for all currently connected clients.  When a
  new client connects but hasn't sent a valid line, or sends a line
  with no centroid, use 0.00 for its contribution.
